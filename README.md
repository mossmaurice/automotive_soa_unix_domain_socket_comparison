# Comparison of an automotive SOA implemented with Eclipse iceoryx and UNIX domain sockets

This is an adapted version of the [automotive SOA binding](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx-automotive-soa)
based on [Eclipse iceoryx](https://iceoryx.io).

The aim of this version is to benchmark the latency of an iceoryx-based solution against a
[UNIX-domain-socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket)-based one.

For installation instructions and further information please refer to
[this Readme](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx-automotive-soa/blob/main/README.md).
